Geo-tagged tweets and visualization


# INTRODUCTION

This is a project for my Geography 458 class anI created two maps using QGIS and created two word clouds using Word Art to compare the generated tweets from the United States and Europe. I applied the same stream filter to both of the files of the code and only changed the coordinates for location.

Geo-tagged tweets and visualization


# INTRODUCTION

This is a project for my Geography 458 class at the University of Washington. I created two maps using QGIS and created two word clouds using Word Art to compare the generated tweets from North America and Europe. I applied the same stream filter ('happy') to both of the files of the code and only changed the coordinates for location. Addionally, the tweets from the two continents were generated at two different time points to allow for some variance in the tweets collected. However, it is important to note that both tweets from the two continents were collected during the same day and month. 

# MAP COMPARISON

The tweets generated from North America were larger than that of the tweets collected in Europe. This result might indicate how North American's are frequent users of Twitter. On the other hand, the tweets generated in Europe were extremely spread out and quite sparse. This might indicate that the app is not as popular in Europe.
